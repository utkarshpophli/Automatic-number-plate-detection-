# Automatic Number Plate Recognition

In today's security landscape, automation is crucial, yet many existing solutions lack robustness. This project focuses on license plate recognition using Python, utilizing OpenCV for plate identification and pytesseract for character extraction. It also presents an efficient ALPR system based on the YOLO object detector, culminating in a web app that achieves high accuracy, approximately 90-95%, in recognizing license plates from low-resolution images


## Use cases
License plate detection involves identifying the part of a car predicted to be the number plate, while recognition entails identifying the values on the plate. Using computer vision, license plate detection and recognition technology identifies and reads license plates from car images. It finds applications in various fields, including traffic monitoring, security surveillance for premises access, and parking management.

## Deep learning for object detection

INCEPTION-RESNET-V2 MODEL BUILDING

Inception-ResNet-v2 is a deep convolutional neural network trained on over a million images from ImageNet. With 164 layers, it can classify images into 1000 object categories. Its architecture combines Inception structures with Residual connections, enhancing feature representations. This network was utilized for classification tasks, leveraging its ability to mitigate degradation issues in deep structures and reduce training time.
